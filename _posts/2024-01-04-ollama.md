Tell me about the history of computer. 

The history of computers dates back to the early 19th century, with the invention of mechanical calculators. These devices were designed to perform arithmetic operations and were used primarily by scientists and engineers. The first electronic computer, called the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC), was developed in 1945 for military purposes during World War II. It was a massive machine that occupied an entire room and could perform complex calculations at incredible speeds.

In the years following ENIAC's creation, computers continued to evolve rapidly. The first commercially available computer, called the UNIVAC I, was introduced in 1951. This marked the beginning of the personal computer era, as it allowed individuals and businesses to have their own computing power without relying on large institutions or government agencies.

The 1970s saw significant advancements in computer technology with the introduction of microprocessors, which are small electronic circuits that can be integrated into a single chip. This made computers smaller, faster, and more affordable for everyday use. The development of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) also revolutionized the way people interacted with computers, making them more accessible to non-technical users.

In the 1980s, personal computers became even more popular with the introduction of the IBM PC and Microsoft's Windows operating system. This led to a boom in software development, as companies began creating programs for various applications such as word processing, spreadsheets, and games. The rise of the internet also had a significant impact on computer history, as it allowed people to connect and share information across vast distances.

The 1990s saw the advent of powerful personal computers with high-speed processors and large amounts of RAM (random access memory). This led to the development of new technologies such as 3D graphics, multimedia applications, and networking capabilities. The rise of the World Wide Web in the early 1990s further transformed the way people accessed information and interacted with each other online.

In recent years, computers have become even more integrated into our daily lives, with smartphones, tablets, and smart devices becoming increasingly popular. These devices are capable of performing complex tasks and accessing vast amounts of information on the internet. The development of cloud computing has also changed the way we store and access data, allowing us to access files from anywhere in the world.

Today, computers continue to evolve at a rapid pace, with advancements in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and quantum computing promising even more exciting developments in the future. As technology continues to progress, it is clear that computers will play an increasingly important role in shaping our lives and society as a whole.

how to make zettelkasten system?

To create a zettelkasten system, follow these steps:

1. Gather index cards or small pieces of paper and label them with numbers or keywords for easy organization.
2. Choose a method for organizing your notes, such as alphabetical order, date, or subject.
3. Create an index file to keep track of your notes by labeling it with a name that reflects the content, like "Notes on Personal Development."
4. Begin adding notes to your zettelkasten system by writing down key points and ideas related to your topic. Be sure to include the date of creation for future reference.
5. As you add more notes, consider using tags or keywords to further categorize your content. This will make it easier to locate specific information later on.
6. To ensure easy access to your notes, store them in a binder or folder that is organized by topic and date. You can also use digital tools like note-taking apps for added convenience.
7. Regularly review and update your zettelkasten system as new ideas and information become available. This will help you stay on top of your learning and personal development goals.
8. Finally, make it a habit to consistently maintain your zettelkasten system by adding notes regularly and reviewing them periodically. This will ensure that your knowledge base remains organized and accessible for future use.Ô∏è

Large pre-trained language models have been shown to store factual knowledge in their parameters, and achieve state-of-the-art results when fine-tuned on downstream NLP tasks. However, their ability to access and precisely manipulate knowledge is still limited, and hence on knowledge-intensive tasks, their performance lags behind task-specific architectures. Additionally, providing provenance for their decisions and updating their world knowledge remain open research problems. Pre-trained models with a differentiable access mechanism to explicit non-parametric memory can overcome this issue, but have so far been only investigated for extractive downstream tasks. We explore a general-purpose fine-tuning recipe for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) -- models which combine pre-trained parametric and non-parametric memory for language generation. We introduce RAG models where the parametric memory is a pre-trained seq2seq model and the non-parametric memory is a dense vector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural retriever. We compare two RAG formulations, one which conditions on the same retrieved passages across the whole generated sequence, the other can use different passages per token. We fine-tune and evaluate our models on a wide range of knowledge-intensive NLP tasks and set the state-of-the-art on three open domain QA tasks, outperforming parametric seq2seq models and task-specific retrieve-and-extract architectures. For language generation tasks, we find that RAG models generate more specific, diverse and factual language than a state-of-the-art parametric-only seq2seq baseline.

how to brush teeth properly?

To brush your teeth properly, follow these steps:

1. Choose the right toothbrush: Select a soft-bristled toothbrush with rounded edges to prevent gum irritation. Make sure it fits comfortably in your hand and has a small head for better reach into tight spaces.

2. Apply the right amount of toothpaste: Use a pea-sized amount of fluoride toothpaste, as recommended by dental professionals. This will ensure effective cleaning without excessive foam or taste.

3. Position the toothbrush correctly: Hold the toothbrush at a 45-degree angle to your gums and teeth. Gently move the brush in small circular motions, focusing on one area at a time. Avoid scrubbing too hard, as this can damage your enamel.

4. Brush all surfaces of your teeth: Make sure to clean the outer, inner, and chewing surfaces of each tooth. Don't forget to also brush your tongue to remove bacteria and freshen your breath.

5. Clean between your teeth: Use dental floss or an interdental brush to reach areas where a toothbrush can't reach. This helps prevent plaque buildup and gum disease.

6. Brush for at least two minutes: Spend the recommended time brushing your teeth, which is around two minutes. You can use a timer or sing a short song to help you keep track of time.

7. Rinse thoroughly: After brushing, rinse your mouth with water to remove any remaining toothpaste and debris. This will also help prevent cavities and freshen your breath.

8. Replace your toothbrush regularly: It's essential to replace your toothbrush every three to four months or sooner if the bristles become frayed. Using a worn-out toothbrush can be less effective in cleaning your teeth.

By following these steps, you'll ensure that you're brushing your teeth properly and maintaining good oral hygiene.Ô∏è
