## intro. Cunningham's law

> "The best way to get the right answer on the internet is not to ask a question; it's to post the wrong answer."

ref. Cunningham's Law (LinkedIn) | [Link](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/cunninghams-law-mazrul-naim/)

it's funny. :)


## (1) Answer questions even when you're not sure

Answering not as an expert,
just answering it could be wrong, 
but it will be closer to the right answer with people in public.

> Half of the class was dedicated to discussions, but I hardly spoke. Part of it was due to my English proficiency, but mostly because the reading materials already contained the 'answers,' and everything worth saying seemed to have been said already. Other students were quite talkative. Some of what they said seemed unrelated to the questions, more like a free-for-all, and it irritated me to see the teacher nodding along. I didn't want to contribute meaningless chatter just to seem foolish. In the end, instead of becoming a 'good student,' I ended up as a seemingly nonexistent one throughout the 12-week course.

## PI chat 

me:
> I think questions are two categories, one is easy to search myself, another is too difficult to everyone to answer, so there's no need to question on the seminars or courses, and offline engagements. how do you think about it?

pi:
> I understand where you're coming from, but I think that asking questions, even if they may seem easy to search or difficult to answer, can still be valuable in a seminar or offline engagement. Here's why:
1. Different perspectives: Even if a question seems easy to search, you may get a different perspective or insight from the person you're asking.
2. Stimulating discussion: Asking difficult questions can stimulate discussion and get people thinking about a topic in a new way.
3. Building relationships: Asking questions, even simple ones, can help you build relationships with others and create opportunities for further conversation and collaboration.
4. Clarifying understanding: Sometimes, asking a question out loud, even if you think you know the answer, can help solidify your understanding or reveal a gap in your knowledge.

> I believe questions in seminars or courses serve multiple purposes beyond just seeking answers. They can be used to stimulate critical thinking, encourage participation, and foster discussion among peers. While it's true that some questions may be easily answered through personal research, the act of discussing them in a group setting can provide valuable insights, perspectives, and collaborative learning experiences.

> Similarly, questions that are perceived as too difficult for everyone to answer can still be valuable for promoting curiosity, pushing boundaries of knowledge, and inspiring further exploration. They may prompt participants to think creatively, seek additional resources, or even spark debates that lead to deeper understanding.

> Ultimately, the effectiveness of questions in seminars or courses depends on various factors, including their relevance to the topic, their ability to engage participants, and the facilitation of meaningful discussions. Instead of avoiding questions altogether based on their perceived difficulty or ease of search, it might be more beneficial to carefully select and frame questions that promote active participation, critical thinking, and collaborative learning within the context of the learning environment.
